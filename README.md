Project Overview: Job Portal Application

In this project, I designed and developed a full-featured job portal web application aimed at streamlining the recruitment process for employers and job seekers alike.

Key Features and Functionality:

User Roles & Authentication:
The application supports two primary user roles: Recruiters and Applicants. A secure authentication system allows users to register and log in based on their role. Each user type has access to features tailored to their needs.

Recruiter Dashboard:
Recruiters can create and manage their profiles, post new job openings with detailed descriptions, and set specific criteria such as location, salary range, experience level, and job type. Each job listing is published on the platform and made searchable to applicants. Recruiters can also view and manage incoming applications.

Applicant Experience:
Job seekers can create personalized profiles, upload resumes, and browse all available job listings. A dynamic search and filter system allows users to find jobs based on criteria such as keywords, location, or job category. Applicants can view job details and submit applications directly through the platform.

Job Application Management:
The platform tracks applications made by users and allows recruiters to review and manage them in real-time. Additional features include bookmarking jobs, application history, and status updates.

Tech Stack Highlights (customizable based on your actual implementation):

Frontend: React / Angular / Vue (or plain HTML/CSS/JS)

Backend: Node.js / Django / Flask / Laravel

Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL

Authentication: JWT / OAuth / Firebase Auth

Hosting: AWS / Heroku / Netlify / Vercel

Outcome:
The platform provides an intuitive, user-friendly experience that simplifies the hiring process for recruiters while offering a convenient job search and application experience for candidates.
